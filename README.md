## 🏗️ Manifest and Evidence Standards

This manifesto defines the quality and ethics of my work, which are essential for judicial admissibility.

| Principle | Description | Judicial Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Evidence First** | Every finding must be documented to stand in court: traceability, reproduction, and clear documentation. | **Irrefutable Chain of Custody (CoC).** |
| **Focus on the Human** | Study of persuasion psychology to build awareness programs and defense against **fraud/Social Engineering**. | **Internal Risk Mitigation.** |
| **Detection Production** | Every offensive case generates a countermeasure (Sigma, YARA, IR Playbooks) ready for industrialization. | **From Investigation to Mitigation.** |
| **Technical Transparency** | Versioned repository, artifacts with **redacted IOCs**, and included mitigations. | **Auditable and Replicable.** |
