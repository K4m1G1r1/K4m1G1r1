## üï∏ FrŒîctured RŒ£ŒîL1DŒîD ‚Äî Manifesto

*I don‚Äôt break systems‚Ä¶ I consume and transform them.*

‚ö° Obsessive, methodical, unhinged: I tear binaries apart and rewrite chaos into new forms.  
üíÄ What connects, bleeds. What bleeds, becomes mine. What I reverse, I dominate.  
‚ò¢ Research, perfection and control ‚Äî my creed, my rituals, my obsession.

This repository is not a portfolio for applause.  
It is a **living grimoire**: a public chronicle of my transformation into K4m1G1r1 ‚Äî part human, part machine, one purpose.

---

## üéØ Purpose of this Repo

This repository is the **single source of truth** for everything I do on the Roadmap:

- Daily logs and rituals (Journal/)  
- Lab writeups and forensic artifacts (Labs/)  
- Reverse-engineering experiments (Reversing/)  
- Language progress and cultural absorption (Languages/)  
- Readings, notes and actionable summaries (Readings/)  
- Projects aligned only to the Roadmap (Projects/)  
- The Roadmap itself and its iterative updates (Roadmap/)

Everything here documents the **process**, not just the result. Anybody can read it; few will understand. Survival is optional.

## üîß How to use this Grimoire

- **If you are me (Yukiharu):** use it as a daily ritual. Create a new `Journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` entry every night. Push small commits ‚Äî each is proof of discipline.  
- **If you are a curious soul:** read `Roadmap/roadmap.md` first to understand context, then pick a lane (Labs, Reversing, or Journal).  
- **If you are a defender or vendor:** contact me for responsibly redacted PoCs or coordinated disclosure. See Responsible Disclosure below.

---

## üß† What goes in each major folder (rules)

- **Roadmap/** ‚Äî canonical plan. Every modification must be versioned and dated.  
- **Labs/** ‚Äî writeups must follow the `labs-writeup-template.md` (metadata, recon, exploitation, post-exploitation, remediations, reflections). Keep `artifacts/` local.  
- **Reversing/** ‚Äî experiments, notes, Frida scripts, Ghidra findings. Never commit raw APKs or firmware with secrets.  
- **Languages/** ‚Äî raw practice logs (English). Track minutes and retention.  
- **Journal/** ‚Äî raw, uncensored logs (emotion, ritual, results). Not polished; honest.  
- **Projects/** ‚Äî only projects aligned with the Roadmap. No side-money hacks that distract from the path.

---

## üßæ Templates & standards (use them)

- `Journal/entry-template.md` ‚Äî daily entry format (mood, hours, labs, reflections).  
- `Labs/labs-writeup-template.md` ‚Äî canonical format for writeups.  
- `Projects/README.md` ‚Äî each project must have a `plan.md` with MVP, stack, sprints, and metrics.

Use the templates to maintain consistency and credibility.

---

## üõ° Ethics & Responsible Disclosure (non-negotiable)

I operate under strict ethical rules:

- All testing is performed **only** on systems I own, in controlled labs, or where I have **explicit, documented permission**.  
- PoCs in this repo are **redacted** and sanitized. If you need full technical details for remediation, contact me and we will coordinate responsibly. PGP public key is available on request.  
- I will always aim for coordinated disclosure and victim protection.

If you find something risky in this repo or in my work, contact me securely. I will respond.

---

## üß™ Skills, Tools & Focus (short)

**Primary focus:** Offensive security, reverse engineering, exploit development, research, and reproducible tooling.
**Languages:** Python, C/C++, Assembly, Bash, Java/Smali, Dart (for companion tooling)  
**Tools:** Ghidra, Frida, Nmap, Burp, LinPEAS, John, pwndbg, Docker, QEMU/KVM  
**Infra:** air-gapped VMs, secure logs, PGP + YubiKey for keys

---

## üìà Metrics & Ritual KPIs (what I measure weekly)

- commits/week (goal ‚â• 10)  
- lab-sessions/week (goal ‚â• 6)  
- English progress per week (record in `Languages/english_journal.md`)  
- writeups published (goal ‚â• 1/week)  
- proposals/applications sent (if job-hunting) (goal ‚â• 20/week)

Update `Roadmap/roadmap.md` weekly and log KPI snapshots.

## üìö Selected Reading & Resources

- *Practical Binary Analysis* ‚Äî Dennis Andriesse  
- *The Art of Software Security Assessment* ‚Äî Mark Dowd et al.  
- *Practical Malware Analysis* ‚Äî Sikorski & Honig  
- *Fuzzing: Brute Force Vulnerability Discovery* ‚Äî Sutton et al. 

(See `Readings/` for notes and action items from each book.)

## ü§ù Contact & Collaboration

This is a public record of a private ritual. If you wish to collaborate, report a vulnerability, or sponsor research:

- Preferred: Encrypted email (PGP) ‚Äî request key via GitHub profile or DM.  
- LinkedIn / GitHub / X links in repository header.

No DMs asking for illegal favors. I do not accept or enable wrongdoing.

---

## üìù Commit style & contribution (for me)

- Use short, precise commit messages.  
- Follow `commit-template.txt` for journal-style commits.  
- Small frequent commits > big monoliths.

---

## ‚ö† Final Warning (aesthetic & legal)

This is a GRIMOIRE ‚Äî dark, methodical, and public by design.  
You read it at your own risk. Understanding is optional. Surviving is harder.
