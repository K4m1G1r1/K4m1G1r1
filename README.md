## 🕷️ FrΔctured RΣΔL1DΔD  
*"I don’t break systems… I consume and transform them."*

> ⚡ **Obsessive, methodical, and unhinged digital beast — tearing binaries apart and rewriting chaos into new forms.**  
> 💀 What connects, bleeds. What bleeds, becomes mine. What I reverse, I dominate.  
> ☢ Research, perfection, and control: my creed, my rituals, my obsession.

Every exploit whispers. Every binary hides secrets. Every system fears dissection.  
⚠️ Welcome to K4m1G1r1’s abyss — there’s no turning back.

## 🖤 Who I Am
**Tatsumi Yukiharu** (alias **K4m1G1r1**) — Software Analysis & Development Technologist (SENA) & full-time offensive researcher in training.  
I specialize in Red Team operations, reverse engineering, exploit development, and high-value vulnerability research. I train daily, publish clean writeups, and forge tools that harden defenders and humble attackers.

**Core focus:**  
- Offensive Security: Web, Mobile, Cloud, IoT, Active Directory, Red Team ops  
- Reverse Engineering & RE Tooling: Ghidra, IDA, Frida, dynamic instrumentation  
- Exploit Development & Zero-Day Research: safe lab PoCs, coordinated disclosure  
- Automation & Tooling: pipelines, CI for research, reproducible labs

## ⚔️ Projects & Artifacts (highlights)
> _Public, safe, and responsibly redacted work only. For lab PoCs and vendor disclosures, request access through secure channels._

- `k4-recon` — automation for large-scale enumeration (public, non-destructive)  
- `k4-frida-scripts` — instrumentation helpers for Android reversing (safe, lab use)  
- `writeups/` — cleaned CTF & lab reports (English + short JP summary)  
- `research/` — responsibly-sanitized research notes & disclosure templates

*(See the `projects/` folder for available public items.)*

## 🔐 Responsible Disclosure & Ethical Stance
I operate under a strict ethical code: all exploit testing is performed **only** on systems I own or where I have explicit written permission. I practice coordinated disclosure and prioritize defender safety.  
If you discover an issue related to my work, contact me securely: `<> [at] <>` (PGP available on request).
